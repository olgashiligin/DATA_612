Radicalism, especially in a political context, is associated with extreme views and the desire for rapid social change. The precise definition naturally varies by country, depending on existing social structures and political climates. For example, in the U.S., the idea of overhauling the health care system to replace private insurance with a public plan is often perceived as radical, while Canadians consider their government-funded health care to be quite normal. The idea of eliminating university tuition is a more radical proposal in Canada — in some provinces more than others — yet in Norway, university has long been free for everyone (even foreigners), and citizens receive stipends while pursuing their studies.

If we consider radicalism as views that go against norm and fundamentally different from the mainstream, it is not a bad thing as it provides  views diversity and I do not see any reasonable grounds here to ban the radical content.  

Unfortunately, nowadays term radicalism sometimes is equated with terrorism. Why not to simply ban the content like this? Why not to simply ban sensitive content like suicide or pro-anorexia topics? I think AI can cope with this task.
