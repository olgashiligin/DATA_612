Dating Recommender System
--------------------------

The purpose of the project is to build a recommender system for a dating agency which allows dating agency to improve its service for matchmaking between potential couples, with a view toward romance and/or marriage between them.
Collaborative filtering will be employed as a main method for building recommender system. User-based and item-based approach will be implemented and tuned with different parameters. Advantages of matrix factorization techniques and hybrid models for improving recommendations will be assessed via various evaluation methods.
The project will be done in Python using "Surprise" - Python scikit building and analyzing recommender systems library.
